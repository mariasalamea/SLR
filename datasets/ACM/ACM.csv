Initially, each contract describes either a component (e.g., a robot) or an aspect of the system. Then, the design problem is decomposed into different synthesis and verification sub-problems, allowing to tackle the complexity involved in the design process. The design problem is then recomposed by exploiting the rigorousness provided by contracts. This allows us to achieve system-level simulation capable to be used for validating the entire design. Once validated, the software synthesized during the process can be integrated into Robot Operating System (ROS) nodes and executed using state-of-the-practice packages and tools for modern robotic systems. We apply the methodology to generate a control strategy for an autonomous goods transportation system.

The use of such APIs requires the programmers to learn them, and add complexity to the final parallel solution. Mercury provides a platform for the transformation of serial applications into parallel Bag-of-Tasks. Mercury reads a configuration file stating what methods and classes should be parallelized, loads the application, and in run-time transforms it so that the specified methods are executed concurrently. This transformation is performed without user intervention. Its modular design allows the integration of Mercury with different parallel environments. The initial experiments done show that the overhead is minimal, and that it is possible to take advantage of parallel processing environments (multiprocessors/multicores, clusters, ...) without the use of complex APIs.","2009-12-01","2020-08-16 10:25:52","2020-08-16 10:25:52","2020-08-16","1–6","","","","","","Mercury","ARM '09","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/Pablo/Zotero/storage/ITUBQSP7/Silva et al. - 2009 - Mercury a reflective middleware for automatic par.pdf","","","adaptive middleware; automatic parallelization; Bag-of-Tasks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, a variety of research has focused on hardware acceleration of automata processing, especially via spatial architectures that directly map the patterns to massively parallel hardware elements, such as in FPGAs and in-memory solutions. We observed that all existing automata-acceleration architectures are designed based on fixed, 8-bit symbol processing, derived from ASCII processing. However, the alphabet size in pattern-matching applications varies from just a few up to billions of unique symbols. This makes it difficult to provide a universal and efficient mapping of this wide variety of automata applications to existing automata accelerators. In this paper, we present FlexAmata, a compiler solution for efficient adaption of applications with any alphabet size to existing pattern-matching accelerators. We demonstrate that this can increase automata processing efficiency in two ways. First, this improves resource utilization for applications with small alphabets and enables hardware acceleration for applications with very large alphabets (which otherwise would not map to hardware accelerators). Second, this enables the exploration of optimized bitwidth processing for future spatial hardware accelerators. We leverage FlexAmata and investigate the hardware implications of different bitwidth processing rates on the two state-of-the-art spatial accelerators, Cache Automaton (CA) and FPGAs. Our exploration across a wide range of automata benchmarks reveals that 4-bit processing rate on CA and 16-bit processing rate on FPGAs results in higher performance than the default 8-bit processing rate in these existing approaches.","2020-03-09","2020-08-16 10:25:52","2020-08-16 10:25:52","2020-08-16","219–234","","","","","","FlexAmata","ASPLOS '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/Pablo/Zotero/storage/WMEM8LH2/Sadredini et al. - 2020 - FlexAmata A Universal and Efficient Adaption of A.pdf","","","automata processing; compiler; fpgas; memory-centric accelerators; reconfigurable computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a model constructed based on such an assumption may contain redundant predictor metric(s) and/or unnecessary predictor metric complexity. This is because the assumption made before the model construction is not verified after the model is constructed. To resolve the first problem (i.e., possible redundant predictor metric(s)), we propose a statistical hypothesis testing methodology to verify ""retrospectively"" the statistical significance of the impact of each predictor metric on the target metric. If the variation of a predictor metric does not correlate enough with the variation of the target metric, the predictor metric should be deleted from the model. For the second problem (i.e., unnecessary predictor metric complexity), we use ""goodness-of-fit"" to determine whether certain categories of a categorical predictor metric should be combined together. In addition, missing data often appear in the data sample used for constructing the model. We use a modified k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) imputation method to deal with this problem. A study using data from the ""Repository Data Disk - Release 6"" is reported. The results indicate that our methodology can be useful in trimming redundant predictor metrics and identifying unnecessary categories initially assumed for a categorical predictor metric in the model.","2006-04-23","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16","1728–1733","","","","","","","SAC '06","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/Pablo/Zotero/storage/GUZIJEVN/Wong et al. - 2006 - Applying statistical methodology to optimize and s.pdf","","","imputation method; missing data; model optimization; model simplification; models; software metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aims: The objectives are to improve cost estimation by investigating available sizing measures, and providing practical effort estimation models for agile software development projects during the contract bidding phase or earlier. Method: The analysis explores the effects of independent variables for product size, peak staff, and domain on effort. The empirical data for model calibration is from 20 industrial projects completed recently for the US DoD, among a larger dataset of recent projects using other lifecycle processes. Results: Statistical results showed that initial software requirements is a valid size metric for estimating agile software development effort. Prediction accuracy improves when peak staff and domain are added as inputs to the cost models.

The third emphasizes what space is measurable or not; the second, what characteristics are to be measured; and the first, the potential feedback effects of measurement. By a careful exploration of these three fields we shall here demonstrate that a significant advancement can be made in software metrics by adopting a unified “field” theory — viz., there is a fundamental common ground on which to define formal software metric models independent of programming languages, programming methodologies and programming environments. Consequently, a combination of effective structured programming theory and the mathematical postulates of measure theory is a necessary starting point for the validation of software metric models. Structured programming advocates tree-like designs; and the mathematics of the tree structure indicates that the language of structured programming is metrication. With this realization, we here propose some standardized metrics that can be easily applicable by both researchers and practitioners. Others may also be defined on the same space. The notion of “UNIFIED” here means there exists a mathematical space on which to formally define different software metrics as well as validate metrics of software measurements.","1988-02-01","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16","232–238","","","","","","","CSC '88","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/Pablo/Zotero/storage/8VPIGQNU/Ejiogu - 1988 - A unified theory of software metrics.pdf","","","classification of software complexity; feedback effects; ground space; measure theory; size; software characteristics; structural complexity; tree structure; validation; well-structured","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, FPA is affected by several drawbacks: it must be performed by specifically skilled personnel, it is expensive, and the resulting measures are subject to high variability. In order to solve - at least partially - these problems, researchers have proposed to base FP counting on UML models. However, models built without having FPA in mind hardly provide the required information at the proper detail level, so that the measures of the models tend to vary accordingly. On the contrary, building models that are suitable for FPA generally requires additional notations, skills and effort, thus partly spoiling the advantages of the approach. This paper illustrates a technique for building FPA-oriented UML models that do not need to include more information than usually required by the development process, and are easy to measure. As a result, FPA can be performed in a seamless way, while yielding reliable results.

In this context software maintenance is an inevitable activity; further optimizing the activities related to maintenance is not possible due to the lacuna in various aspects of the pre-production phases. Since 1969, the issues raised by Lehman related to software maintenance remain the same. Each issue faced by the maintenance team directly reflects in the quality of the software product. According to the related work, very few research is going on in the field of software maintenance and still scarce when it comes to research on incident and associated ticket; a part of corrective maintenance. In depth research on incident tickets should be viewed as critical since, it provides information related to the kind of maintenance activities that is performed in any timestamp. Therefore classifying and analyzing tickets becomes a critical task in managing the operations of the service since each incident will be having a service level agreement associated with it. Further, incident analysis is essential to identify the patterns associated. Due to the existence of huge population of software in each organization and millions of incidents get reported per software product every year, it is practically impossible to manually analyze all the tickets. This paper focuses on projecting the importance of ticket analytics to maintain the quality of software products and also identifying the incidents and related tickets based on various factors which are supported by a case study from the data collected from various organizations.","2016-03-21","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16","126–130","","","","","","Significance of Ticket Analytics in Effective Software Maintenance","WIR '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/Pablo/Zotero/storage/2CFS47SF/Christa and Suma - 2016 - Significance of Ticket Analytics in Effective Soft.pdf","","","Incident; Incident Classification; Software Maintenance; Software Quality; Ticket Analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a new approach for the hardware design of sensor networks based on a multi-criteria cost optimization by means of evolutionary algorithms. During an automated selection procedure of several implementation variants, not only expenditures for development and fabrication are considered, but also additional objectives like time to market or process complexity. A design tool was realized in order to support the development of very cost-efficient sensor networks. The integration of specific cost models allows the designer to identify the appropriate architecture variants and technology options. The verification of the design tool resulted in valuable knowledge about sensor nodes especially for specific application scenarios. A prototype for condition monitoring was designed and discussed regarding options for cost optimization.","2009-04-13","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16 10:35:18","2020-08-16","313–324","","","","","","SENESCOPE","IPSN '09","","","","IEEE Computer Society","USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/Pablo/Zotero/storage/QF2UU3Q8/Niedermayer et al. - 2009 - SENESCOPE A design tool for cost optimization of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Earned Value Analysis present itself as an easy-to-understand technique that helps to monitor and control project's performance. This article presents a sequence of steps which allows the integration of software functional sizing metrics, COCOMO II and Earned Value Analysis in the processes recommended by the PMBoK for planning and controlling software development projects. The goal of such a sequence of steps is to help project managers to plan, monitor and control software development projects using the PMBoK and software functional metrics. The two metrics were chosen as the basic units due to their large acceptance by industry. COCOMO is a technique largely adopted in the software engineering area.

We investigate the impact of the class project on student academic achievement and project success in terms of the quality of the code of the developed system. We gauge the impact of the class project by analysing differences the academic performance of the students in the course. Further, we analyzed the differences in assessment marks assigned to projects.
